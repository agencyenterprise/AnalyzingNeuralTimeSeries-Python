# Analyzing Neural Time Series Data: Theory and Practice - Python Implementation

This repository hosts the Python implementation of code from the amazing book by Mike X Cohen, "[Analyzing Neural Time Series Data: Theory and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Neural-Time-Data-Practice/dp/0262019876/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27317GNOGVB1V&keywords=Analyzing+Neural+Time+Series+Data%3A+Theory+and+Practice&qid=1706987627&s=books&sprefix=analyzing+neural+time+series+data+theory+and+practice%2Cstripbooks%2C237&sr=1-1)" (MIT Press, 2012), translating the original MATLAB scripts for Python users. 

The book has been inspirational to many of us at AE Studio and our friends, so we hope this Python reimplementation helps many more people get started with the wonders of neural data analysis.
